## Research Interests

To the grand goal of explainable and intelligent systems, I am currently interested in integrating deep language AI with symbolic systems, knowledge representation, and reinforcement learning.

**Current research interests:**

- Explainable / Interpretable NLP training and inference
- NLP with symbolic systems (Logic, Compiler, Knowledge base, …)
- Language models as Reinforcement Learning agents
